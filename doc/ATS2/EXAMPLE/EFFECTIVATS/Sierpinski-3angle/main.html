<h1>
Effective ATS:<br>
Drawing Sierpinski triangles
</h1>

<p>
In this article, I would like to give an example that
combines ATS code with JavaScript (JS) code. This is also
an occasion for me to advocate refinement-based programming.
</p>

<h2>
Setup for animation
</h2>

The following code implements a typical setup for doing animation:

<b>Pats2xhtmlization failed</b><br>sh: 1: pats2xhtml: not found
<!--php-->

<p>
The code is self-explanatory: [drawAnim] is the main function to be
called for doing animation; it calls [drawAnim_init] to do some form of
initialization and then [drawAnim_loop] to start a loop that repeatedly
draws a frame (by calling [drawFrame]) and sleeps (by calling [sleep]).
</p>

<p>
However, the call to [sleep] inside the body of [drawAnim_loop] is
problematic. As we want to run the animation inside a browser, calling
[sleep], if supported, means to stop the browzer entirely, which is
probably unacceptable. Instead, [drawAnim_loop] can be implemented as
follows:
</p>

<b>Pats2xhtmlization failed</b><br>sh: 1: pats2xhtml: not found
<!--php-->

<p>
Essentially, the call to the external function [setTimeout] in
JS requests that the browser schedule a call to [drawAnim_loop]
1000 milliseconds (that is, 1 second) after the time when the call is made.
</p>

<p>
I present as follows a simple implementation of [drawFrame] in JS
directly so as to allow the reader to obtain a concrete feel for the
above animation setup:
</p>

<b>Pats2xhtmlization failed</b><br>sh: 1: pats2xhtml: not found
<!--php-->

<p>
I do not plan to go over the JS code in detail.  Essentially, it locates a
canvas identified by the string "Patsoptaas-Evaluate-canvas". The
implementation of [drawFrame] paints the entire canvas with blue and
yellow, alternately. The entirety of the code presented so far is stored in
<u>Sierpinski-3angle-part.dats</u>, which can be readily tested
<a href="http://www.ats-lang.org/SERVER/MYCODE/Patsoptaas_serve.php?mycode_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats/master/doc/EXAMPLE/EFFECTIVATS/Sierpinski-3angle/Sierpinski-3angle-part.dats">on-line</a>.

<h2>
Drawing Sierpinski triangles
</h2>

<p>
The reader can take a look at an animated drawing of Sierpinski triangles
<a href="http://www.ats-lang.org/SERVER/MYCODE/Patsoptaas_serve.php?mycode_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib/master/projects/SMALL/JSmydraw/Sierpinski_3angle/Sierpinski_3angle_php.dats">on-line</a>.
</p>

<p>
Given a natural number, a Sierpinski triangle at level n can be defined
inductively on n. A regular triangle is regarded as a Sierpinski triangle
at level 0. For a positive number n, a triangle ABC is a Sierpinski
triangle at level n if the three triangles APR, PBQ, and RQC are Sierpinski
triangles at level n-1, where P, Q, and R are the midpoints of the three
sides AB, BC and CA, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Let us introduce an abstract type [color] for colors
and use [BLUE] and [YELLOW] to refer to two colors defined in JS
of the same names:
</p>

<b>Pats2xhtmlization failed</b><br>sh: 1: pats2xhtml: not found
<!--php-->

<p>
Following is the interface of a function [drawTriangle],
which is called to draw a triangle ABC filled with a given
color:
</p>

<b>Pats2xhtmlization failed</b><br>sh: 1: pats2xhtml: not found
<!--php-->

<p>
Let us introduce another function [drawSTriangle]
for drawing a Sierpinski triangle filled with a given color
and then implement it based on the function [drawTriangle]:
</p>

<b>Pats2xhtmlization failed</b><br>sh: 1: pats2xhtml: not found
<!--php-->

<p>
The function [drawFrame] can be implemented as follows:
</p>

<b>Pats2xhtmlization failed</b><br>sh: 1: pats2xhtml: not found
<!--php-->

<p>
After the canvas for drawing is located, three points A, B and C are
choosen on the canvas to be the vertices of a Sierpinski triangle. The
x-y-coordinates of A can be obtained by calling [theAx_get] and
[theAy_get], which are implemented in JS.  The x-y-coordinates of B and C
can be obtained similarly. The function [theLevel_getinc] is called to
yield the level of the Sierpinski triangle to be drawn. Please find all
the details in the following JS code, which also includes an implementation
of [drawTriangle]:
</p>

<b>Pats2xhtmlization failed</b><br>sh: 1: pats2xhtml: not found
<!--php-->

<p>
The entirety of the code for this implementation of
an animated drawing of Sierpinski triangles is stored in
<u>Sierpinski-3angle-final.dats</u>, which can be readily tested
<a href="http://www.ats-lang.org/SERVER/MYCODE/Patsoptaas_serve.php?mycode_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats/master/doc/EXAMPLE/EFFECTIVATS/Sierpinski-3angle/Sierpinski-3angle-final.dats">on-line</a>.
Of course, it is also possible to use <u>patsopt</u> to compile
<u>Sierpinski-3angle-final.dats</u> into some C code and then use
<u>atscc2js</u> to compile the C code into some JS code. Please
find the related details in the provided Makefile. There is a file
<u>Sierpinski-3angle.html</u> available for testing the generated JS code.
